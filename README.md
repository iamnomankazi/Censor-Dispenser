This Python project automates email content filtering. 
It intercepts emails and redacts sensitive information like proprietary data, negative language, and excessive punctuation. 
This ensures only relevant and appropriate content reaches recipients, minimizing the risk of unintentional information leaks, particularly to third parties, board members, or investors.
